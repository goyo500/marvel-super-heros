# Marvel Heroes App

Marvel Heroes is a master detail Android app on the api https://developer.marvel.com/docs API.

This app is coded in Kotlin using Clean Architecture (MVVM).

The app works in offline mode, if it has no saved data, it makes a request to the API, then saves
the result and displays it to the user.

When the user clicks on a hero the app will search the DB for the detail. If it does not have it, it
will query the API, save the result and show the detail to the user. Last step, Detail View shows
the selected hero data.

## Architecture and project organization

this app has been coded following [**Clean
Architecture**](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
paradigm, a concept with an increasing popularity thanks to Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).

### Class hierarchy

* **Presentation**
  This layer's duties consist of managing the events caused by the user interactions, and rendering
  the information coming from the _domain_ layer. In this particular case, the team has opted for
  using the
  Model-View-ViewModel ([MVVM](https://proandroiddev.com/mvvm-architecture-viewmodel-and-livedata-part-1-604f50cda1))
  architecture pattern. This entity "sees" the _domain_ layer.

* **Domain**
  This layer is in charge of the application business logic. It is built upon _use-cases_ and
  repositories (_repository pattern_). The _domain_ layer obtains data from the _data_ module, use
  them to perform all the required operations, and format the outcomes to later deliver them to
  the _presentation_ layer. This layer represents the most inner entity, and thus it does not "see"
  anyone but itself.

* **Data**
  This layer simply contains libraries and frameworks which provide data to the application (data
  sources). Among them, stand out service-query frameworks (_Retrofit_), local databases (_Room_),
  events tracking (Omniture), etc. This layer "sees" the _domain_ layer.

The usage of this class hierarchy and package organization pursues grasping the **SOLID**
principles, getting more flexible when implementing new functionality, and easing code testing.

### Inversion of Control

In order to facilitate the interaction between layers this app
uses **[Koin](https://www.raywenderlich.com/9457-dependency-injection-with-koin)** is a framework
which allows to abstract type injection in a neat and clear manner.

### Coroutines

Since _multithreading_ has historically been a challenge in Android Development, the team has
decided to
include [coroutines](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-coroutines/#0). This is
one of the most interesting and appealing features recently introduced in Kotlin.

The main advantage that supports the usage of _coroutines_ is an easy and enhanced multithreading
management. _Coroutines_  allow to turn asynchronous operations in synchronous code, without
affecting the application overall performance.

From the _execution-flow_ perspective, every task is undertaken in the main thread (UI thread),
until a _use-case_ is invoked. From that moment onwards, operations are handled in worker threads,
to later retrieve the computed results in the main thread again.

### Database

One of the objectives of this app is that it can be used offline.

For this reason, a Room database is used to store all the data to be displayed as they are
consulted. Room provides an abstraction layer on top of SQLite that enables seamless database access
while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
